      "body": "After two weeks abroad, I was looking forward to returning to the U.S. this weekend, but as I got off the plane at LAX on Sunday, I wasn't sure what country I was coming back to.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s recent executive order is not only potentially unconstitutional, but deeply un-American. We are a nation of immigrants, after all. In the tech world, we often talk about a startup\u2019s \u201cunfair advantage\u201d that allows it to beat competitors. Welcoming immigrants and refugees has been our country's unfair advantage, and coming from an immigrant family has been mine as an entrepreneur.\n\nAs many of you know, I am the son of an undocumented immigrant from Germany and the great grandson of refugees who fled the Armenian Genocide.\n\nA little over a century ago, a Turkish soldier decided my great grandfather was too young to kill after cutting down his parents in front of him; instead of turning the sword on the boy, the soldier sent him to an orphanage. Many Armenians, including my great grandmother, found sanctuary in Aleppo, Syria\u2014before the two reconnected and found their way to Ellis Island. Thankfully they weren't retained, rather they found this message:\n\n*\u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d*\n\nMy great grandfather didn\u2019t speak much English, but he worked hard, and was able to get a job at Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company in Binghamton, NY. That was his family's golden door. And though he and my great grandmother had four children, all born in the U.S., immigration continued to reshape their family, generation after generation. The one son they had\u2014my grandfather [(here\u2019s his AMA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/29039l/iam_john_ohanian_92_year_old_lawyer_parttime/)\u2014volunteered to serve in the Second World War and married a French-Armenian immigrant. And my mother, a native of Hamburg, Germany, decided to leave her friends, family, and education behind after falling in love with my father, who was born in San Francisco.\n\nShe got a student visa, came to the U.S. and then worked as an au pair, uprooting her entire life for love in a foreign land. She overstayed her visa. She should have left, but she didn't. After she and my father married, she received a green card, which she kept for over a decade until she became a citizen. I grew up speaking German, but she insisted I focus on my English in order to be successful. She eventually got her citizenship and I\u2019ll never forget her swearing in ceremony.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen people taking the pledge of allegiance for the first time as U.S. Citizens, it will move you: a room full of people who can really appreciate what I was lucky enough to grow up with, simply by being born in Brooklyn. It thrills me to write reference letters for enterprising founders who are looking to get visas to start their companies here, to create value and jobs for these United States.\n\nMy forebears were brave refugees who found a home in this country. I\u2019ve always been proud to live in a country that said yes to these shell-shocked immigrants from a strange land, that created a path for a woman who wanted only to work hard and start a family here. \n\nWithout them, there\u2019s no me, and there\u2019s no Reddit. We are Americans. Let\u2019s not forget that we\u2019ve thrived as a nation because we\u2019ve been a beacon for the courageous\u2014the tired, the poor, the tempest-tossed.\n\nRight now, Lady Liberty\u2019s lamp is dimming, which is why it's more important than ever that we speak out and show up to support all those for whom it shines\u2014past, present, and future. I ask you to do this however you see fit, whether it's calling your representative (this works, it's how we defeated SOPA + PIPA), marching in protest, [donating to the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/secure/donate-to-aclu), or voting, of course, and not just for Presidential elections.\n\nOur platform, like our country, thrives the more people and communities we have within it. Reddit, Inc. will continue to welcome all citizens of the world to our digital community and our office.\n\n\u2014Alexis\n\n**And for all of you American redditors who are immigrants, children of immigrants, or children\u2019s children of immigrants, we invite you to share your family\u2019s story in the comments.**",

      "body": "[Here's the link!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjppRUKhBxE/?taken-by=alexisohanian)\n\nAsk me anything in the comments and chat with me on Instagram Live RIGHT NOW.\n\n**Update!**\n\nTop 10 Dad Tips based on questions from that IG Live session I hosted with my good friends at Johnnie Walker in celebration of my first real Father\u2019s Day. (I tried to save the video from the first hour, but it crashed, so I only have the 20minutes I did after that)\n\n1. Take care of yourselves, dads (and dads\\-to\\-be!). The day I found out I was going to be a father was the day I started changing my lifestyle. I fully support having a more healthy and active lifestyle and encourage doing everything in moderation! Don\u2019t get me wrong I like to celebrate here and there but moderation is key. When I do choose to toast to a special milestone (like Father\u2019s Day), I like to have a glass of the good stuff\u2014Johnnie Walker Blue Label. I've done an OK job taking care of myself for my first 34 years and I promised the little poppy seed I would spend my next 34 doing a much better job so I could be around and at my best for as long as possible. Or long enough to be uploaded.  \n\n2. I'm finding ways to connect with her even at this early age that are special for the two of us. Most of them involve me making her feel like she's either in a jet, rocketship, or racecar, but between the sound effects and all the movement she really has a great time. I talk to her a little bit in German and I wish I could speak more French to my daughter, because she's learning from her mom and nanny and I just know it's going to be their secret language to plot against me.  \n\n3. Don't try to do everything perfectly. There's no one way to be a dad and none of us are perfect. She's gonna hurt herself, or she's going to be sad and you can't quite figure out why, or you're going to be staring at her at 4am wondering what it was like to get a full night of sleep \\-\\- and it's OK to be frustrated. No one is perfect, your kid is going to be OK, just keep doing your best and tell your partner you love them, often. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. Fatherhood is an incredible journey and it is worth taking a step back to celebrate the small wins (your first diaper changed!) along with the big wins (first steps!) \u2014 everything matters. Be sure to take it all in. Enjoy a glass of Johnnie Walker Blue Label to celebrate all the moments along the way with your partner.  \n\n4. There's no one book to rule them all. I think it's worth reading a couple, but they're suggestions and ideas, not instruction manuals. Every kid is different, but it is valuable to get ideas. [Like the baby football method for soothing a baby!](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc3JNR1BWK3/?hl=en) I learned that from the *Happiest Baby on the Block*.  \n\n5. Take full advantage of your parental leave policy. If you don't have one at your company and can do something about it, you should. Both Reddit and Initialized have fantastic 16 week programs for parents and I hope more companies follow suit because it's a huge asset when a workforce believes there's a process for taking time to be with their families and their jobs won't be at risk while they're away.  \n\n6. Double or triple up the layers of changing pads on the changing table so that you can just tear one away in the middle of the night if it gets soiled and not worry about finding a replacement at that moment because you just want to be done and put the baby back to sleep.  \n\n7. I know it's not cheap, but I (and Junior) loved the Snoo bed (and not just because of the name) for the first 6 months or so.  \n\n8. Take photos and videos, lots of them. I know it takes up a lot of space on your phone and I'm trying to build a better solution myself, but you'll want those. More importantly your kid will want the best ones of those. Make some selfie videos with you and your partner, too. [You can even stitch them all\\-together into a video for your kid later.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYoRmfI0LUc)  \n\n9. Don't forget about your partner. You need to be at your best to be the best parents and a big part of that is loving your other half. Agree ahead of time that things said at 4am while sleep deprived and with a baby crying are 'safe' from being used against you later, that is to say, be forgiving (thanks, Serena) and make sure you get time for yourselves, too. Nurture that relationship because it's the bedrock of your new kid's life.  \n\n10. Subscribe to and read r/daddit (and r/predaddit)! It's been helpful all along the way.\n\nAnd here's a bonus dad joke (from r/dadjokes)\n\n*If you put your left shoe on the wrong foot...* *It\u2019s on the right foot*\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/comments/8ortjl/if\\_you\\_put\\_your\\_left\\_shoe\\_on\\_the\\_wrong\\_foot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/comments/8ortjl/if_you_put_your_left_shoe_on_the_wrong_foot/)\n\nCheers!",
