      "body": "Just wanted to drop a brief 2cents regarding the current, and ongoing, state of this platform and its constant loud discourse around the pros and cons of reddit as a whole and the volunteer moderators that help run it. \n\nDiscourse in general online is becoming harder to achieve due to polarized discussions often feeling like a war of two fronts, instead of an open ended and open minded conversation. \n\nPersonally, after spending too much time on here and on every other social platform, i can say that one thing is for certain: no platform is perfect and some are more complicit than others in just ignoring the blazing fires and cracks in their free product while cashing in the revenues before attempting to truly fix anything (this applies to all platforms and not one specifically). \n\nReddit is great, but reddit is also flawed in some ways, big and small. One thing i learned here was that volunteer moderation needs to be revisited and patched up, and the administration needed to do a bit more in terms of addressing and mitigating issues with their userbase in general. Moderating at one point felt like being the expendable volunteer buffer between the paid administration doing their job, and its very angry and concerned audience that often felt ignored or unheard. Which is why i stepped down from most subs i used to moderate at the expense of my own peace of mind. \n\nWhat was supposed to be a fun online time killer hobby eventually turned into a mentally destructive and exhausting volunteering chore. \n\nTo my fellow comods and to the general reddit audiences on all fronts, think of your peace of mind and mental health while spending time online. \n\nThat\u2019s all. \n\nAlso please post more dog pictures.",
