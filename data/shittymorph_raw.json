It was a very strange \"Hail Mary\" for a smile... and much to my surprise and against odds, it worked. Now for the last 5+ years thousands of people have been laughing and smiling with me.  The pain from the loss of my father has dulled and these smiles will continue for years to come (hopefully).  Truly, thank you all from the bottom of my heart for helping me through my hard times just by being receptive to my shinnanigans.  This meme is so much more than just a reference to nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.

Things are still being developed and worked on... unfortunately as of right now my thank you messages to anonymous tippers are not being delivered. I do my best to write a thank you message for every gild I receive and have been doing the same for the tips. So, if you have tipped me and I didn't say thank you please know that the replies I have sent are getting lost along the way. I want to let you guys know that I do appreciate the generosity and kindness... the admins are working to get my replies to go through but for now I'll leave this message up as a thank you.

You have 1 month to contact me for your prize.  I will also be sending PMs to remind the winners that they won.  I will pass your addresses on to the manufactures who will be shipping directly from their warehouses.  Thank you to everyone who participated in the contest.  If you have any questions feel free to private message me. Until next time...\n\n........................................................................................................... \n\nIt's been almost a year since the last joke contest so I've decided to run another one. During previous contests I have given \"reddit gold\" to the winners.  I wanted to give away something better for this contest so I have partnered up with a couple of companies who will be providing the prizes.  \n  \n\n**The Prizes**    \n\n(1) 1st Place Prize \n   \n[Zpacks Plexamid Ultralight Tent](http://www.zpacks.com/shelter/plexamid.shtml) ($550.00 Value)  \n\n  \n(25) 2nd Place Prizes  \n  \n[Zalman Gm4 Gaming Mouse](https://zalmanoutlet.com/products/zm-gm4?utm_source=Reddit&utm_campaign=redditmorph) and [Zalman K900M RGB Mechanical Keyboard](https://zalmanoutlet.com/products/zm-k900m-white-mechanical-keyboard-kaihl-brown-switches?utm_source=Reddit&utm_campaign=redditmorph&utm_term=one) ($100.00 Value)  \n\n  \n(10) 3rd Place Prizes  \n1 Month of Reddit Premium Membership (Reddit Gold)  \n  \n**Contest Rules**  \n\nEach redditor can submit up to TWO jokes to the comment section of this post.  Jokes can be any style or length.  The contest will run from 8/20/2018 - 9/3/2018.  I will pick the winners on 9/4/2018.  Due to shipping costs, in order to win a prize you must have an address in the United States.  Having the most upvotes does not guarantee a win - unfortunately \"contest mode\" is not available on profiles so I want to make that clear. Products will be shipped directly from the manufacture.  The manufacture will also be covering shipping costs.  Winners will be listed on this post on 9/4 or 9/5 and will need to private message me an address for shipping purposes.  \nAlso for the next two weeks contest sponsor [Zalman](https://zalmanoutlet.com/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_campaign=redditmorph&utm_term=one) is offering a 50% discount on EVERY SINGLE ITEM on their website if you checkout with the promo code: redditmorph  \n\nBring your best jokes and win some cool stuff.  Let the laughs begin!\n",

I gave out almost 100 reddit golds between the contests and my April Fools Gold thread.  This time I'm going with a compliment contest.  I'm inspired by /u/IGiveFreeCompliments who has also started to frequently post hell in the cell comments.  I think if we can give out enough genuine compliments we will actually be making reddit a (slightly) better place.  Your goal is to go out into reddit and give covert compliments to people.  The only word you must use is \"mankind\"  - it doesn't have to refer to the wrestler... can refer to humankind... but that word must be included in your compliment. We don't want people to assume your compliment is for a contest... make them genuine.  Link back here to your efforts.  Best, most genuine compliments will win gold... or a [Morph beanie with this logo](http://imgur.com/a/XMebC) - They will be black... that green background is just for the guy who is stitching them up.  I am making 5 beanies to give out... If you win you will be able to choose between the beanie or the reddit gold via private message.  I will not be selling anything ever from this account so these beanies will be limited edition for sure...   Contest will run from 6/8 - 6/20... Winners to be announced around the end of the contest.\n\nEDIT: CONTEST IS OVER!  I will pick a couple of winners tonight\n\nWinners are:   \n/u/SergeantSanchez  \n/u/Grover_Cleavland  \n/u/PNG_FTW  \n/u/hipipop   \n/u/harmboi  \n/u/TenureAz  \n\nThe guy is lagging on stitching my beanies in spite of the fact that I have already paid him.  I will give each of you gold tomorrow - and when the beanies come in I will private message you individually and ask if you want me to send you one.  I think we will do another joke contest in the near future.  Thank you all for participating.  - SM\n\n\n",

I know people know me for making up crazy stories - This might sound like bullshit... but it is absolutely 100% true.\n\nAbout 7 years ago my then 5 year old son had an unfortunate event happen to him.  He had a few items stolen from him and was upset about it and not understanding why someone would steal from him.  I uploaded a video of us discussing what had happened to youtube and shared on facebook - it went viral to some degree. After a week or so I got a message in my inbox from Jimmy Kimmel saying he saw my son's video and wanted to do something nice for him.  He replaced my son's stolen items and actually had us both on his show (via skype).   Obviously he didn't have to do this. Now I understand maybe shows do this with viral videos to boost their own ratings but I truly believe Jimmy Kimmel has a heart of gold...  I haven't heard from anyone at Jimmy Kimmel Live since the show aired...  but hearing of his struggle with his own son really breaks my heart - especially after what he did for mine.\n\nI'm wishing him and his son the best possible outcome... really wish I could do something for them like he did for us...

This milk is high in carbs and low in fat and typically will flow at the beginning of a breastfeeding session. There is also something called \"Hindmilk\" which is much higher in fat and usually comes at the end of the breastfeeding session. If the milk flows too forcefully or quickly, the baby could fill up in an unhealthy way on the foremilk. Foremilk is also VERY high in lactose which can cause a baby to become extremely gassy - there have even been a few instances where the babies will suddenly start talking about how back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcers table.",

She ended up with severe burns trying to dig into a firepit in hopes of saving her dog.  This clip is actually a really good PSA - people putting out fires with sand has been an ongoing issue for those of us living on the coast since nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off h\u0435ll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.",

Usually, it's a younger animal that has been spooked and is in a panic - on most occasions the animal will trip and fall and  the injuries are insignificant.  However, I have seen some gruesome injuries over the years - we had a steer get his front leg caught while running over the guard and the momentum of his body weight caused his leg to almost rip clean off.  We had a mobile vet come out to see if she could do anything to help him but sadly she told us that in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off h\u0435ll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.",

In high school he was a multi-sport athlete before he ended up joining the Air Force - he played football while in the Air Force as well.  At 45 years old he went back and played semi-pro football and started to pick up side jobs working as a ref for highschool games. He ended up going viral based on several videos like this one which showed him outrunning much younger people on the field.  He's about 55 years old these days and the last update I can find on him was that he moved to Sacramento back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off h\u0435ll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.",

I thought I was a bit of a rebel back then and all through my entire rebellion I probably never looked more ridiculous.  \n\nTo give you an idea of how impractical the style was: I normally wore size 30x30 pants - but all my Jncos were at least 40x40 and I needed an extra long belt to keep them up.  Then there was the problem of constantly stepping on them when you walked which in some cases would cause you to pull down your own pants. Looking back it was a real blessing when the trend finally died down in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off h\u0435ll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.  \n\n",

They tend to yawn before a meal if the prey is larger in size and yawning after a meal is usually for them to realign their jaws into a more normal position.

During his study he noticed that the dogs would start to salivate even just by hearing the footsteps of his assistant who was in charge of bringing in their food.  Discovering that a sound or event could evoke the same response from the dogs as being presented with actual food Pavlov realized he had made an important scientific discovery.

At the factory the chips are intentionally stacked in boxes upside down to prevent the seasoning from gathering at the bottom.  Also when our trucks are loaded at the warehouse the dock workers load the boxes upside down for the same reason.  It's not until the chips are delivered to the grocery store that they are permanently in an upright position.  Keeping the product upside down until it gets to the retailer has been standard practice at Frito Lay at least since I started working there back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off h\u0435ll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.",
